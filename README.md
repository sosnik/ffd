Fanfiction.net downloader
=========================

My son is reading fanfiction.net Star Wars stories from his Victor Reader(http://www.humanware.com/en-australia/products/blindness/dtb_players/compact_models/_details/id_316/victor_reader_stream_new_generation.html)
So, I wrote this simple script to grab text and convert it to rtf just to play with javascript and save my son from terrible manual cut-and-paste rutine.
